            <h3>Why Reviewing Older Policies Matters</h3>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Inflation's Impact:</strong><br>
                A $20,000 policy in 2005 is equivalent to $30,250 in 2025.<br>
                A $20,000 policy in 2015 is equivalent to $24,000 in 2025.<br>
                This means coverage from 10-20 years ago has less purchasing power today.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strength of Coverage:</strong> May no longer suffice for expenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Relevance:</strong> Life changes (marriage, children, debts).</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Newer policies may offer better rates.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Action Steps:</strong> Initiate conversation on inflation/life changes, assess needs, offer alternatives.</p>

                <span class="tag">(This question helps understand their motivations and priorities, building rapport while allowing you to tailor the conversation towards their specific concerns (e.g., family, debts, medical expenses).</span><br><br>
                Based on this question we can ask:<br><br>
                A. Are you married? (Share your relationship status and name of your loved one)<br>
                (If married or in a relationship) What is the name of your loved one?<br><br>
                B. Do you have any children? How many? What are the names?  (Share feedback and your story)<br><br>
                Now most of my clients are trying to make sure that when the time comes, they aren‚Äôt leaving a financial burden on their family, is that how you feel?<br><br>
                I can definitely understand that.<br>
                I speak to people all over the country and no matter how different each person may be, they all have one thing in common - they want to protect the ones they love‚Ä¶<br><br>

        <!-- Objection Handling -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Objection Handling</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>What is an Objection?</strong><br>
                An objection in a sales call refers to a client or prospect expressing a concern, hesitation, or disagreement regarding a product, service, or offer. Objections can arise due to various reasons, such as cost, perceived value, fit with their needs, trust, competition, or any other factor that creates resistance to making a purchasing decision.
            </div>

            <h3>Reasons Clients May Drop the Call</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of Interest: The client may not currently see a need for life insurance or may not be interested in discussing financial planning at that moment.</li>
                <li>Previous Negative Experience: The client may have had a negative experience with life insurance in the past or may have heard negative stories from others, leading them to be skeptical or uninterested.</li>
                <li>Financial Constraints: The client may have budgetary constraints or may perceive life insurance as an additional financial burden that they cannot afford at the moment.</li>
                <li>Time Constraints: The client may be busy or have limited time to engage in a detailed discussion about life insurance during the phone call.</li>
                <li>Misalignment with Needs: The client may have already purchased life insurance from another provider or may not see the offered policy aligning with their specific needs.</li>
                <li>Preference for Other Financial Products: The client may have a preference for other financial products or investments and may not prioritize life insurance at that time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Objection Handling Guidelines</h3>
            <p><strong>Priority & Secondary Responses:</strong> We have a priority reaction to an objection followed by secondary objection points. (This is just in case you mention a priority objection if the client rebuttals again then we use secondary objection points)</p>
            <p><strong>Use Client's Name:</strong> Mentioning the client's name is very important. There are 2 main reasons: firstly you‚Äôre getting the client‚Äôs attention secondly you have a few seconds to get the rebuttal ready to pitch.</p>
            <p><strong>Avoid Fillers:</strong> We want to avoid filler words like ‚Äúum‚Äù, ‚Äúah‚Äù, ‚Äúoh‚Äù. When reacting to an objection, using the name is always the best option.</p>
            <p><strong>Reaction Time:</strong> Once you get familiarized with objection skills, the next important thing to note would be your reaction time to objections. When you have a faster response time you will also have a greater chance in keeping the client on the phone.</p>
            <p><strong>Acknowledge:</strong> In using objections it's always crucial to take action and be quick with response time, less dead air time is what we want to target. Starting your response with the Client‚Äôs First Name is effective in breaking into conversation. It is also effective when a person seems distracted. Formal and informal, using a formal name is often associated with obedience and can be seen as a sign of respect and comfort. Name calling bonds and creates trust between the qualifier and the client.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge ‚Äì Recognize the prospect‚Äôs concern to build trust</strong><br>
                    Shows empathy and makes them feel heard.<br>
                    Example: "I understand, (Client‚Äôs Name). Many clients feel the same way when considering their options."</li>
                <li><strong>Check ‚Äì Provide insight or a fact to guide the conversation</strong><br>
                    This step reassures them and highlights a key benefit.<br>
                    Example: "The younger and healthier you are, the more affordable life insurance is. Locking in a lower premium now can save you money long-term."</li>
                <li><strong>Ask ‚Äì Use a strategic question to move the conversation forward</strong><br>
                    Encourages engagement and leads back to the sales process.<br>
                    Example: "Wouldn‚Äôt you agree it‚Äôs smart to take advantage of this now? Let‚Äôs do a quick qualification to see your options."</li>

            <h3>Tips for Effective Objection Handling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure you have great tonality: Sounding genuine and concerned will most likely have a calming and positive effect on your client.</li>
                <li>Be an active listener. To build trust with your prospect, it's essential that they feel like you're actually hearing their concerns.</li>
                <li>Use empathy to validate the prospect's concerns. A great technique to handle all types of objections is to empathize with your prospect and let them know that you understand where they're coming from. Once you do that, the prospect will lower their guard, and they'll be more open to accept a solution.</li>
                <li>Build Value: To keep your client engaged and interested, they must see value in our product.</li>
                <li>Please note that excitement is key in every call. The more excited you are, the less, the chances of your client saying they can‚Äôt talk considering they already picked up.</li>
                <li>Additionally when speaking to clients do not ask do you have time to speak this will help reduce objections all together.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Specific Objections & Responses</h3>
            <div class="objection">
                <h4>I'm Not Interested</h4>
                <p><strong>Acknowledge:</strong> I understand <span class="placeholder">(Clients name)</span> deciding on life insurance can be overwhelming and it‚Äôs natural to take time to consider your options do you agree? Many clients feel the same, but taking even a small step now can provide peace of mind and lock in better rates. With that in mind, <span class="placeholder">(Clients name)</span>, have you decided to postpone or do you have a policy in place?</p>
                <p><strong>Decided to Postpone:</strong> I understand, <span class="placeholder">(Clients name)</span>. It‚Äôs normal to want time to consider your options.<br>
                    <strong>Check:</strong> The younger and healthier you are, the more affordable life insurance is. Securing a policy now locks in lower premiums and avoids higher costs later.<br>
                    <strong>Ask:</strong> Wouldn‚Äôt you agree it‚Äôs smart to take advantage of this now? Let‚Äôs do a quick qualification to see your options.<br>
                    <strong>Engage:</strong> I‚Äôll guide you through the process step by step.</p>
                <p><strong>Policy in Place:</strong> I understand, <span class="placeholder">(Clients name)</span>. It‚Äôs great that you‚Äôve already taken steps to secure a policy.<br>
                    <strong>Check:</strong> Many clients with existing policies find it beneficial to shop the market. You might save money or improve your coverage with a quick review.<br>
                    <strong>Ask:</strong> Wouldn't you agree it‚Äôs worth verifying to see if you qualify for better options? Let‚Äôs take a moment to check.<br>
                    <strong>Engage:</strong> I‚Äôll guide you through the process step by step.</p>
                <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This is the first and far most common used Objection. It's very important to not only memorize the objection but also have quick and accurate response. This will provide you more confidence. Ensure you have great tonality: Sounding genuine and concerned will most likely have a calming and positive effect on your client. Be an active listener. To build trust with your prospect, it's essential that they feel like you're actually hearing their concerns. Use empathy to validate the prospect's concerns. A great technique to handle all types of objections is to empathize with your prospect and let them know that you understand where they're coming from.
